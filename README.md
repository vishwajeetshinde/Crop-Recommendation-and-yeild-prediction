# Crop-Recommendation-and-yeild-prediction

### Intoduction :
 The agriculture sector contributes 20% to the countryâ€™s GDP.Around half of the State population is dependent on this sector for their livelihood. The average share of 
 Agriculture and allied activities   sector in the State economy is 11.9 percent.Out of total cultivable land in Maharashtra about 60% land is under food grain crops and 
 Maharashtra contributes only 5.8% production of food grains in India. Crop prediction is really essential for decision making. From the existing systems it is found 
 that crop yield and crop analysis are separately done, so in this work we are including two datasets to recommend crops and yield i.e. crop dataset and soil dataset. To 
 recommend a suitable crop, data analysis is most important. Data analysis includes comparison between different parameters.  The main objective of our proposed system 
 is to help farmers to determine the soil quality by the analysis of  various parameters and to suggest crops based on the results obtained using machine learning 
 algorithms. The system uses the Classification algorithm of K-nearest neighbor and Support Vector Machine (SVM)  to improve the efficiency of the Crop Recommendation 
 System. 

### Dataset :
 Here I used two types of datasets one is crop dataset and second is yeild dataset. Crop dataset contains data on crops like what is the specific phosphorus , Nitrigen, Potassium and pH value for each crop. By using this data we cam able to predict suitable best crop to that respective soil. Another type contains soil dataset which contains parameters like temprature, humidity and rainfall. This dataset also contains yeild data by which we can able to recommend crop as well as predict the yeild and price of that crop.
